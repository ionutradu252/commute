### OpenHack Project — Optimised Urban Carpooling

**Commute** is a smart mobility app that optimizes daily commuting by connecting solo drivers with nearby passengers heading in the same direction.  
It aims to reduce city congestion, save fuel, and make everyday travel more comfortable and efficient.

## 🌍 Overview

Every day, thousands of people drive alone in four- or five-seater cars, while others rely on overcrowded public transport.  
**Commute bridges this gap** by linking drivers who have spare seats with passengers who share similar routes and schedules.

The result: fewer cars on the road, lower emissions, and a smoother, more social commute experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Drivers** set their daily route, departure time, and arrival time.  
2. **Passengers** enter their origin and destination.  
3. **Commute’s algorithm** finds the best driver-passenger match — even if it means a slight detour for the driver.  
4. Both parties confirm the ride and track their trip in real-time.
