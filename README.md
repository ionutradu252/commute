# commute
OpenHack app for optimised carpooling

Commute is an app that optimises public transportation and carpooling.
There are drivers and passengers that commute daily, also many drivers are alone in a 5 or 4 seater vehicle.

Commute helps people that take public transportation to their workplaces everyday and links them to solo drivers in exchage for points. (tbd)

Basically the drivers set their daily commute route, time of leave and arrival, and passengers do so as well. Commute finds the best driver for a passenger, even if that means adding 5 mins to a route to go get the passenger.


What does this do for the people:
-drivers earn points which they can exchange for gas or other merch, stuff, etc
-passengers get to their destinations safer, faster and in more confort
-less crowded city streets because people are encouraged to populate a car more (instead of 4 people in 4 different cars, there are 4 people in one car)

It's not like BlablaCar, Commute works inside of cities, not extra-urban, so it's better
